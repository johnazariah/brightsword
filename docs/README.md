# BrightSword Libraries - Documentation

This `docs` folder provides high-level usage guidance and rationale for the primary libraries in this repository:

- `BrightSword.Feber` — expression-based delegate builders and operation composition.
- `BrightSword.SwissKnife` — small, reusable utility and extension helpers.
- `BrightSword.Squid` — runtime type-emission helpers used to generate DTO-like implementations.

Use the links below to jump to focused guidance and examples:

- `docs/GettingStarted.md` — build, test, and quick-start steps.
- `docs/Feber.md` — how and why to use the `Feber` builder types.
- `docs/SwissKnife.md` — purpose and common helpers in `SwissKnife`.
- `docs/Squid.md` — runtime type creation patterns and examples.
- `docs/Contributing.md` — repository conventions and contribution advice.

These documents are intended to give maintainers and consumers a practical understanding of the libraries, typical usage patterns, and cautions when changing behavior or refactoring.
